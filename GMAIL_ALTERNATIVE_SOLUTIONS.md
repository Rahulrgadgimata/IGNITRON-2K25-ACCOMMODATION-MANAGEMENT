# Gmail Email Setup - Alternative Solutions

## Problem: App Passwords Not Available

If you see "The setting you are looking for is not available for your account", try these solutions:

## Solution 1: Enable 2-Step Verification First

App Passwords require 2-Step Verification to be enabled first.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Find **"2-Step Verification"** section
3. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Turn On"**
4. Follow the setup process (verify phone number, etc.)
5. After enabling, go back to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
6. Now App Passwords should be available!

## Solution 2: Enable "Less Secure App Access" (Not Recommended)

⚠️ **Warning:** This is less secure but might work if App Passwords aren't available.

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll down to **"Less secure app access"**
3. Turn it ON
4. Then try using your regular password

**Note:** Google may have removed this option for some accounts.

## Solution 3: Use OAuth2 (Advanced)

This requires more setup but is more secure.

## Solution 4: Use Different Email Provider

You can use:
- Outlook/Hotmail (smtp-mail.outlook.com)
- Yahoo Mail (smtp.mail.yahoo.com)
- Other SMTP servers

## Recommended: Enable 2-Step Verification

**This is the best solution:**

1. Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification (it's secure and recommended)
3. Then App Passwords will become available
4. Generate App Password for Mail
5. Use that in the system
